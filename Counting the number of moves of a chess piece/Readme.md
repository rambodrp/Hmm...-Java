The first line of the input contains the number n, which is the total number of pieces on the chess board. The next n lines each specify the type and location of the bead. Each of these n lines contains a string of 4 characters.

The first character specifies the color of the bead, which can be one of two characters: W, which means white, or B, which means black.
The second character specifies the type of nut, the possible states of which are specified in the table below.
The third and fourth characters specify the location of the bead

The output should contain m lines, each line containing the answer to a question. The answer to each question is an integer that shows the number of possible moves of that piece. Note that the movements with which one piece grabs another piece are also counted among the moves of that piece.
